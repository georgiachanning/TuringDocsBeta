realize that these are guidelines and not rules this is stated best in the pep8 a style guide is about consistency consistency with this style guide is important consistency within a project is more important consistency within one module or function is most important but most importantly know when to be inconsistent sometimes the style guide just doesn t apply when in doubt use your best judgment look at other examples and decide what looks best and don t hesitate to ask synopsisattempt to follow both the julia contribution guidelines the julia style guide and this guide when convention guidelines conflict this guide takes precedence known conflicts will be noted in this guide use 4 spaces per indentation level no tabs try to adhere to a 92 character line length limit use upper camel case convention for modules and types use lower case with underscores for method names note julia code likes to use lower case without underscores comments are good try to explain the

the argument the argument s type provides this information instead for example buyfood food should be buy food food names of functions should usually be limited to one or two lowercase words ideally write buyfood not buy food but if you are writing a function whose name is hard to read without underscores then please do use them method definitionsonly use short form function definitions when they fit on a single line yes foo x int64 abs x 3 no foobar array data abstractarray t item t where t lt int64 t abs x abs item 3 for x in array data no foobar array data abstractarray t item t where t lt int64 t abs x abs item 3 for x in array data yes function foobar array data abstractarray t item t where t lt int64 return t abs x abs item 3 for x in array data endwhen using long form functions always use the return keyword yes function fnc x t where t result zero t result fna x return resultend no function fnc x t where t result zero t result fna x end yes function foo x y return new x y end no function foo x y new x y endfunctions definitions with parameter lines which exceed 92 characters should separate each parameter by a newline and indent by one level yes function foobar df

splatting a dict yes xy foo x y 3 no xy foo x y 3 whitespaceavoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations immediately inside parentheses square brackets or braces yes spam ham 1 eggs no spam ham 1 eggs immediately before a comma or semicolon yes if x 4 show x y x y y x endno if x 4 show x y x y y x end when using ranges unless additional operators are used yes ham 1 9 ham 1 3 9 ham 1 3

real n where n no f a abstractarray t n where t lt real n g a abstractarray lt real n where n always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side assignment updating operators etc numeric comparisons operators lt gt etc note that this guideline does not apply when performing assignment in method definitions yes i i 1no i i 1yes submitted 1no submitted 1yes x 2 lt yno x 2 lt y assignments using expanded array tuple or function notation should have the first open bracket on the same line assignment operator and the closing bracket should match the indentation level of the assignment alternatively you can perform assignments on a single line when they are short yes arr 1 2 3 arr 1 2 3 result function arg1 arg2 arr 1 2 3 no arr 1 2 3 arr 1 2 3 arr 1 2 3 nested array or

the trailing comma when working with expanded arrays tuples or functions notation this allows future edits to easily move elements around or add additional elements the trailing comma should be excluded when the notation is only on a single line yes arr 1 2 3 result function arg1 arg2 arr 1 2 3 no arr 1 2 3 result function arg1 arg2 arr 1 2 3 triple quotes use the indentation of the lowest

the indentation does not matter for them yes str hello world str hello world cmd program flag value parameter no str hello world commentscomments should be used to state the intended behaviour of code this is especially important when the code is doing something clever that may not be obvious upon first inspection avoid writing comments that state exactly what the code obviously does yes x x 1 compensate for border no x x 1 increment xcomments that contradict the code are much worse than no comments always make a priority of keeping the comments up to date with code changes comments should be complete sentences if a comment is a phrase or sentence its first word should be capitalized unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter never alter the case of identifiers if a comment is short the period at the end can be omitted block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of complete sentences and each sentence should end in a period comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the expression and have a single space after the when referencing julia in documentation note that julia refers to the programming language while julia typically in backticks e g julia refers to the executable a commmentcode another commentmore codetododocumentationit is recommended that most modules types and functions should have docstrings that being said only exported functions are required to be documented avoid documenting methods like as the built in docstring for the function already covers the details well try to document a function and not individual methods where possible as typically all methods will have similar docstrings if you are adding a method to a function which was defined in base or another package only add a docstring if the behaviour of your function deviates from the existing docstring docstrings are written in markdown and should be concise docstring lines should be wrapped at 92 characters bar x y compute the bar index between x and y if y is missing compute the bar index betweenall pairs of columns of x function bar x y when types or methods have lots of parameters it may not be feasible to write a concise docstring in these cases it is recommended you use the templates below note if a section doesn t apply or is overly verbose for example throws if your function doesn t throw an exception it can be excluded it is recommended that you have a blank line between the headings and the content when the content is of sufficient length try to be consistent within a docstring whether you use this additional whitespace note that the additional space is only for reading raw markdown and does not effect the rendered version type template should be skipped if is redundant with the constructor s docstring myarray t n my super awesome array wrapper fields data abstractarray t n stores the array being wrapped metadata dict stores metadata about the array struct myarray t n lt

every file in src should have a complementary file in the test folder containing tests relevant to that file s contents comparisonsmost tests are written in the form test x y since the function doesn t take types into account tests like the following are valid test 1 0 1 avoid adding visual noise into test comparisons yes test value 0 no test value 0 0in cases where you are checking the numerical validity of a model s parameter estimates please use the check numerical function found in test test utils numerical tests jl this function will evaluate a model s parameter estimates using a given

datatype tarray that can be used to create mutable arrays in turing programs to specify distributions of random variables turing programs should use the notation x distr where x is a symbol and distr is a distribution if x is undefined in the model function inside the probabilistic program this puts a random variable named x distributed according to distr in the current scope distr can be a value of any type that implements rand distr which samples a value from the distribution distr if x is defined this is used for conditioning in a style similar to anglican another ppl in this case x is an observed value assumed to have been drawn from the distribution distr the likelihood is computed using logpdf distr y the observe statements should be arranged so that every possible run traverses all

probabilistic model is defined in turing the model function generated by turing can then be used to condition the model onto data subsequently the sample function can be used to generate samples from the posterior distribution in the following example the defined model is conditioned to the date arg1 1 arg2 2 by passing 1 2 to the model function model model name arg 1 arg 2 begin endthe conditioned model can then be passed onto the sample function to run posterior inference model func model name 1 2 chn sample model func hmc perform inference by sampling using hmc the returned chain contains samples of the variables in the model var 1 mean chn var 1 taking the mean of a variable named var 1 the key var 1 can be a symbol or a string for example to fetch x 1 one can use chn symbol x 1 or chn x 1 the benefit of using a symbol to index allows you to retrieve all the parameters associated with that symbol as an example if you have the parameters x 1 x 2 and x 3 calling chn x will return a new chain with only x 1 x 2 and x 3 turing does not have a declarative form more generally the order in which you place the lines of a model macro matters for example the following example works define a simple normal model with unknown mean and variance model model function y begin s poisson 1 y normal s 1 return yendsample model function 10 smc 100 but if we switch the s poisson 1 and y normal s 1 lines the model will no longer sample correctly define a simple normal model with unknown mean and variance model model function y begin y normal s 1 s poisson 1 return yendsample model function 10 smc 100 sampling multiple chainsif you have julia 1 3 or greater you may use psample to sample multiple chains in a multithreaded way generate 4 chains each with 1 000 samples chains psample model sampler 1000 4 for older versions of julia psample may not function correctly if you wish to run multiple chains you can do so with the mapreduce function replace num chains below with however many chains you wish to sample chains mapreduce c gt sample model fun sampler 1000 chainscat 1 num chains the chains variable now contains a chains object which can be indexed by chain to pull out the first chain from the chains object use chains 1 having multiple chains in the same object is valuable for evaluating convergence some diagnostic functions like gelmandiag require multiple chains sampling from an unconditional distribution the prior turing allows you to sample from a declared model s prior by calling the model without specifying inputs or a sampler in the below example we specify a gdemo model which returns two variables x and y the model includes x and y as arguments but calling the function without passing in x or y means that turing s compiler will assume they are missing values to draw from the relevant distribution the return statement is necessary to retrieve the sampled x and y values model gdemo x y begin s inversegamma 2 3 m normal 0 sqrt s x normal m sqrt s y normal m sqrt s return x yendassign the function without inputs to a variable and turing will produce a sample from the prior distribution samples from p x y g prior sample gdemo g prior sample output 0 685690547873451 1 1972706455914328 sampling from a conditional distribution the posterior using missingvalues that are missing are treated as parameters to be estimated this can be useful if you want to simulate draws for that parameter or if you are sampling from a conditional distribution turing v0 6 7 supports the following syntax model gdemo x begin s inversegamma 2 3 m

1 5 model gdemo missing 1 5 c sample model hmc 0 01 5 500 using argument defaultsturing models can also be treated as generative by providing default values in the model declaration and then calling that model without arguments suppose we wish to generate data according to the model s sim text inversegamma 2 3 m sim text normal 0 sqrt s x i sim text normal m sqrt s space i 1 dots10 each x i can be generated by turing in the model below if x is not provided when the function is called x will default to vector real undef 10 a 10 element array of real values the sampler will then treat x as a parameter and generate those quantities using turing declare a model with a default value model generative x vector real undef 10 begin s inversegamma 2 3 m normal 0 sqrt s for i in 1 length x x i normal m sqrt s end return s mendthis model can be called in a traditional fashion with an argument vector of any size the values 1 5 and 2 0 will be observed by the sampler m generative 1 5 2 0 chain sample m hmc 0 01 5 1000 we can generate observations by providing no arguments in the sample call this call will generate a vector of 10 values every sampler iteration generated sample generative hmc 0 01 5 1000 the generated quantities can then be accessed by pulling them out of the chain to access all the x values we first subset the chain using generated x xs generated x you can access the values inside a chain several ways turn them into a dataframe object use their raw axisarray form create a three dimensional array object convert to a dataframe dataframe xs retrieve an axisarray xs value retrieve a basic 3d array xs value datawhat to use as a default valuecurrently the actual value of the default argument does not matter only the dimensions and type of a non atomic value are relevant turing uses default values to pre allocate vectors when they are treated as parameters because if the value is not provided the model will not know the size or type of a vector consider the following model model generator x begin s inversegamma 2 3 m normal 0 sqrt s for i in 1 length x x i normal m sqrt s end return s mendif we are trying to generate random random values from the generator model and we call sample generator hmc 1000 0 01 5 we will receive an error this is because there is no way to determine length x whether x is a vector and the type of the values in x a sensible default value might be model generator x zeros 10 begin s inversegamma 2 3 m normal 0 sqrt s for i in 1 length x x i normal m sqrt s end return s mendin this case the model compiler can now determine that x is a vector float64 1 of length 10 and the model will work as intended it doesn t matter what the values in the vector are at current x will be treated as a parameter if it assumes its default value i e no value was provided in the function call for that variable the element type of the vector or matrix should match the type of the random variable lt integer for discrete random variables and lt abstractfloat for continuous random variables moreover if the continuous random variable is to be sampled using a hamiltonian sampler the vector s element type needs to be real to enable auto differentiation through the model which uses special number types that are sub types of real finally when using a particle sampler a tarray should be used beyond the basicscompositional sampling using gibbsturing jl provides a gibbs interface to combine different samplers for example one can combine an hmc sampler with a pg sampler to run inference for different parameters in a single model as below model simple choice xs begin p beta 2 2 z bernoulli p for i in 1 length xs if z 1 xs i normal 0 1 else xs i normal 2 1 end endendsimple choice f simple choice 1 5 2 0 0 3 chn
